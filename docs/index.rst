Ethereum WebAssembly (ewasm)
============================

Ethereum WebAssembly is a proposed redesign of the Ethereum smart contract execution layer using a deterministic subset of WebAssembly.

The use of WebAssembly as a format for smart contracts gains a variety of benefits, a few of which are listed below:
- Near-native execution speed for smart contracts
- The possibility to develop smart contracts in many traditional programming languages, such as C, C++, and Rust 
- Access to a vast developer community and the toolchain surrounding WebAssembly

Ethereum WebAssembly is currently under active development. Please feel free to join the discussion!
